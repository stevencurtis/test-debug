Placing shared mocks in a test-only framework is a practice that can offer several benefits, especially in larger projects or those with multiple modules requiring consistent mock implementations for unit or integration testing. Here are some key considerations and benefits of using a test-only framework for shared mocks:

Advantages
Reusability: Shared mocks in a test-only framework can be reused across different test targets within the same project or even across projects, if necessary. This reduces duplication and ensures consistency in how components are mocked.
Maintainability: Centralizing mock objects in a single framework simplifies maintenance. Updates to mock implementations or interfaces need to be made in one place, making it easier to manage changes over time.
Separation of Concerns: Keeping mocks separate from production code and individual test suites helps maintain a clean architecture. A test-only framework ensures that mock objects are not accidentally included in the production build, potentially leading to cleaner and more secure application binaries.
Improved Collaboration: When working in a team, a shared framework for mocks can improve collaboration by providing a single source of truth for how dependencies are mocked. This can be particularly beneficial in ensuring that all team members use the same versions and implementations of mock objects.
Efficiency: Having a dedicated framework for mocks can speed up the setup time for writing new tests, as developers can leverage existing mocks without needing to reimplement or copy them into new test targets.
Considerations
Setup Overhead: Creating and maintaining a separate framework for mocks requires some initial setup and ongoing maintenance. The benefits of this approach should outweigh the overhead, which is more likely in larger projects.
Dependency Management: If the test-only framework is used across multiple projects, you'll need to manage its versioning and distribution, similar to any other dependency. This might involve setting up a private package repository or integrating it into your continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
Access Control: Carefully consider the access levels of the mocks within the framework. While you want them to be accessible to all relevant test targets, you also want to ensure they're not accessible to the production code.
